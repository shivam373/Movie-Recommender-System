## 📌 Overview
The **Movie Recommender System** is a content-based recommendation engine that suggests movies based on user preferences. It leverages **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze movie metadata and provide personalized recommendations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Content-Based Filtering** using movie overviews, genres, and other metadata
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text processing
- **Cosine Similarity** to measure movie relevance
- **Interactive User Interface** (if applicable)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data handling
- **Scikit-Learn** for NLP and similarity measures
- **Flask** (if deployed as a web app)
